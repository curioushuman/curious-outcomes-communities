# TODO

## 1. Authenticate

To keep in line with other repositories we should test we can authenticate with our MongoDb repository. I started it, but had to get something out the door and other tests failing will highlight this result as well.

## 2. Liveness

Similarly, not high priority at this point and will be picked up by other tests having failed.
