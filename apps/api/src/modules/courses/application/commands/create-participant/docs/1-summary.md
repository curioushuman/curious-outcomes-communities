This isn't in Khalil's structure, but I want to record it here as it is part of my thinking.

  - updateParticipantSource

## 4. Decisions

### IMPORTANT

- This command will fail if a participant is not already a user
  - The decision was made to make the creation of a user a separate function
  - AND the logic behind the auto-creation of this user to be more visible within Step functions

### Other

- We only support (creation of participants in) external systems for now
  - In the future we WILL expand for self-registration
- External record info not updatable from custom admin
- NO extra data administer-able from our admin

## 5. Open Questions/actions

- None
